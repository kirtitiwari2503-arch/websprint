# Semester Sync 🎓 
### *Empowering Engineering Students through Structured Productivity*

**Semester Sync** is a high-performance frontend web application built for **WebSprint 2026**. It is specifically designed to solve the "cluttered dashboard" problem faced by engineering students by providing a streamlined, academic-first task management system.
